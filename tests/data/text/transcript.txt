FINDINGS:  LUNGS AND PLEURA: There is a focal airspace opacity in the right lower lobe, consistent with airspace disease. The remaining lung parenchyma is clear. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or significant pleural effusion.  HEART AND MEDIASTINUM: The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  BONES: The visualized osseous structures, including the ribs, clavicles, and thoracic spine, are unremarkable for acute fracture or lytic lesion.  SOFT TISSUES: The overlying soft tissues are unremarkable.
